## Literature Review
Logistic Regression is an algorithm that is used to predict certain scenarios, for example, spam or not spam, 0 or 1 and many more.

Logistic Regression is as well based on probability concept. We use sigmoid function to map the the predicted values to probabilities

When using Logistic regression we are always needed to call the logistic regression instance object to initialize the Logistic Regression function.
